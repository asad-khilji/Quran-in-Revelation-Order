The Prophet followed the tradition of Ibrahim as he sought solitude in the cave searching for the truth. The Prophet spent a number of nights in the cave then he would go back to the cave after taking some provisions. Then Khadija would bring food and water directly to the Prophet without him asking her. Then the Quran and the truth came to the Prophet while he was in the cave during Ramadhan on one of the last 10 odd nights.</p>

The Prophet said I cannot read nor have I ever read anything. Then the angel grabbed him tightly until he could not breathe and then he let him go and the angel said read. The Prophet said I cannot read. This is like the angel is tranferrring the knowledge to the Prophet heart to heart.

As the Prophet was coming down he saw the angel in its true form that covered the whole sky. The angel said Muhammad I am Jibreel and you Muhammad are the Messenger of God. Then the Prophet rushed home to Khadija.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Khadija comforts the Prophet</h2>
        <p class="post-text">The Prophet got home and said to Khadija to cover him. Khadija covered him with a blanket. After a while the Prophet calmed down. The Prophet tells Khadija everything.

Waraqa says that was Namuse or the one that carries a secret of the heavens. The one that was sent to Musa before. Waraqa wished he could join the Prophet and support when his people would kick him out of his city. The Prophet was shocked that his people would drive him away.
